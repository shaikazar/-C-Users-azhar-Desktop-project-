            <h1>LAPTOP INTRUDUCTION</h1>
               <p> A laptop, sometimes called a notebook computer by manufacturers, 
                is a battery- or AC-powered personal computer (PC) smaller than a 
                briefcase. A laptop can be easily transported and used in
                 temporary spaces such as on airplanes,
                 in libraries, temporary offices and at meetings.
